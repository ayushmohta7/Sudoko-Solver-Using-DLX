# Sudoko-Solver-Using-DLX

## Overview

The Suoko Solver is an efficient algorithm designed to solve Sudoku puzzles using Donald Knuth's Algorithm X with the Dancing Links (DLX) data structure. Algorithm X is a backtracking algorithm that efficiently finds all exact covers in a matrix representation of the problem.The DLX technique optimizes this process by dynamically managing the matrix, enabling rapid additions and removals of constraints during the search.
